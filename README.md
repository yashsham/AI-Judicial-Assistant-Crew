# AI Judicial Assistant ‚öñÔ∏è

This project implements an advanced, multi-agent AI system designed to assist the Indian judiciary by automating the preliminary analysis of legal cases. The system uses a crew of specialized AI agents to process uploaded case documents, analyze them against the Constitution of India using a RAG pipeline, research legal precedents, and synthesize a comprehensive "Preliminary Judicial Note."

## Features ‚ú®

* **ü§ñ Autonomous Four-Agent Crew:** A team of specialized AI agents collaborate to perform a full legal analysis workflow:
    1.  **`CaseIntakeAgent`**: Summarizes the core facts from uploaded case files.
    2.  **`ConstitutionalQueryAgent`**: Identifies constitutional issues and retrieves relevant articles using a RAG pipeline built on the Constitution of India.
    3.  **`LegalPrecedentAgent`**: Researches and identifies relevant historical case law.
    4.  **`SynthesisAgent`**: Compiles all information into a final, structured judicial note.
* **üáÆüá≥ Constitutional RAG:** A powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation system built on the full text of the Constitution of India allows for precise, context-aware legal queries.
* **üìÑ PDF Processing:** Capable of ingesting and analyzing multiple PDF case documents.
* **üåê Interactive UI:** A clean and user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit for uploading files and viewing the final analysis.
